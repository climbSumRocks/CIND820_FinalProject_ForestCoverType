# Introduction
This report contains my initial code for examining my data set, which will be used in classifying and predicting forest cover types in Roosevelt National Forest in Colorado, USA. My data comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/covtype/).

# Preparation Work
## Loading Libraries
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(psych)
library(GGally)
library(scales)
library(texreg)
library(corrplot)
library(caret)
library(randomForest)
```
## Data Exploration
Loading the data
```{r}
covtype.data <- read.csv("~/School/CIND820/data/covtype.data.gz", header=FALSE, stringsAsFactors=TRUE)
View(covtype.data)
```
Changing the name of the data
```{r}
data<-covtype.data
```
Looking at the first few rows of data
```{r}
head(data)
```
Adding column names based off the *covtype.info* document
```{r}
colnames(data)<-c("elev", "aspect", "slope", "hHydro", "vHydro", "hRoad", "hs09", "hs12", "hs15", "hFire", "wild1", "wild2", "wild3", "wild4", "s1", "s2", "s3", "s4", "s5", "s6", "s7", "s8", "s9", "s10", "s11", "s12", "s13", "s14", "s15", "s16", "s17", "s18", "s19", "s20", "s21", "s22", "s23", "s24", "s25", "s26", "s27", "s28", "s29", "s30", "s31", "s32", "s33", "s34", "s35", "s36", "s37", "s38", "s39", "s40", "treeType")
```
Verifying the column names have been updated
```{r}
head(data)
```
Looking at the last few rows of data
```{r}
tail(data)
```
Verifying that there are no missing values
```{r}
colSums(is.na(data))
```
Looking at the structure of the data
```{r}
str(data)
```
Looking at the basic data statistics
```{r}
summary(data)
```
The mean elevation of the area is 2959 m. The mean distance to water is 269.4 m. The mean distance to roads is 2350 m.The median tree type is number 2, also known as the lodgepole pine.
The summary function is not really useful for wilderness area or soil type attributes as they are multiple binary columns. 

To determine soil count numbers, the sum function will be used.
```{r}
sum(data$s1 !=0)
sum(data$s32 !=0)
```
Soil type 32 has the most instances of 52519 (it also has the highest mean value from the summary function).

The psych package will be used to take a closer look at the data.
```{r}
describe(data)
```
This gives a mean and standard deviation for all attributes, but it is only useful for first 10 attributes.
Lets create a table for each wilderness type to view the number of instances for each attribute.
```{r}
table(data$wild1)
table(data$wild2)
table(data$wild3)
table(data$wild4)
```
This indicates that there are 260796 instances for wilderness area 1 (Rawah), 29884 instances for wilderness area 2 (Neota), 253364 instances for wilderness area 3 (Comanche Peak), and 36968 instances for wilderness area 4 (Cache la Poudre).
The Rawah wilderness area has the most instances in the collected data, next is Comanche Peak.

Lets create a table of the different tree types.
```{r}
table(data$treeType)
```
This means there are 211840 instances of tree type 1 (spruce/fir), 283301 instances of tree type 2 (lodgepole pine), 35754 instances of tree type 3 (ponderosa pine), 2747 instances of tree type 4 (cottonwood/willow), 9493 instances of tree type 5 (aspen), 17367 instances of tree type 6 (douglas-fir), and 20510 instances of tree type 7 (krummholz). Tree type 2, or lodgepole pine, is the most frequent tree type found in the national forest. Cottonwood/willow trees are the most rare tree type in the forest.

Lets look at the distribution of elevation for the data set.
```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x=elev))+geom_histogram(binwidth=50)
```
